    "In the early days computers (around 1980s) did not have much more then a 10 MB storage capacity. It's really mind blowing that you have ten thousand times as much now in your phone then you did back then. The problem is that the files we want to store seem to keep pace with that growth. How can we store more data with less space? The answear is compression! (I don't expext you to be surprised). There are a lot of compression algorithms but we are going to talk about a specific one.

Two possible decodings of this encoded string are thus given by cdb and babe. However, such a code is useful when the set of all possible source symbols is completely known and finite, or when there are restrictions (for example a formal syntax) that determine if source elements of this extension are acceptable. Such restrictions permit the decoding of the original message by checking which of the possible source symbols mapped to the same symbol are valid under those restrictions."

Second option is to prefix the bit sequence with a header containing enough information to reconstruct the Huffman encoding tree. You can store that sequence at the head of the file in a human readable format. Reading this it will allow you to recreate the the tree"
